      <p class="description__paragraph">In 1971 Massimo Osti founds Chester Perry brand. The name is that of the factory where Bristow, the hero of Frank Dickens’ strip, works. Massimo, working from his experience as a graphic designer, immediately created a distinctive style of communicating for his company: the toy car, the posters with their pop graphics and other props to give as gifts to shop owners.To print t-shirts, jackets and shorts Massimo employs methods that at the time are only usually used for paper: he makes abundant use of the photocopier, placed print screenprinting and the four colour process.</p>
